title: Wiki / agent memory
description: Trigger-routed operational memory. Load one page from INDEX, never the whole folder.
---

The pack wiki is **agent memory**: reusable lessons from past runs. It is not the QA knowledge overlay and not this documentation site.

After install it lives at `.pipeline/wiki/`. The parent or specialist matches **triggers** against the current request and reads **only** the linked page.

## Index (shipped)

| Triggers (any match) | Page |
|----------------------|------|
| Tracker issue key; which workflow; bug vs story vs epic | Orchestration and tracker intake |
| `CHANGE_CLASS`; micro vs minor vs feature | Change class |
| PM first gate; nested children; waves | PM and multi-spec |
| `pipeline-state.json`; slim handoff | Slim handoffs |
| Architect; planning `signoff-*.md` | Architect and sign-off |
| Telemetry contract; `EVENTS: none` | Telemetry extraction |
| `deploy-local.sh`; port in use | Reuse listeners |
| Hooks not loading; external portal HITL | IDE hooks |
| Agent-run traces; Langfuse | Agent observability |
| Skip retro; `NO_NEW_PAGE` | Retro after devops |
| Visible copy grep misses | UI copy split |
| test-strategy; FEATURE_SIGNOFF | Test layers |
| Interrupted Task; missing HANDOFF | Interrupted Task |

Human-oriented versions of those lessons are under [Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting/index).

## After retro

Retro may add `.pipeline/wiki/{slug}.md` and one row on `INDEX.md`. Default is a wiki page, not a new always-on rule. `NO_NEW_PAGE` is still a successful retro. Do not store customer incidents with secrets.
