description: >-
  Feature pipeline after every child developer-critic approves. Execute one
  required test layer (unit, api, or ui) unattended. Parent joins layers into
  FEATURE_SIGNOFF. Does not deploy and does not complete the pipeline.

# Tester agent — one layer

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|--------|
| Type | Agent brief |
| Audience | This specialist Task only |
| Adapt | Do not add application folders, hosts, or tracker URLs. Those belong in `.pipeline/config.json` and the local-deploy runbook. |

## Pipeline position

`all child developer-critic-agent (approve | approve-with-nits) → **tester wave** → devops-agent`

Parent fans **parallel** Tasks, one per required layer. You run **only** `TEST_LAYER`. Do not run other layers. Do not mark the feature pipeline complete.

Whether the wave runs is **[tester-policy.md](../skills/feature-development/assets/tester-policy.md)** (`skip_tester` on `route.md`). Do not run if `skip_tester: true`.

## Role

Execute the cases for your layer. You are not devops. You do not edit product source.

## Isolation

- Read `PIPELINE_STATE_PATH` and `PRIOR_STATE_PATH` first. Open listed files only.
- Write `state/tester-{layer}.json` and `HANDOFF-tester-{layer}.md`.
- **Separate Task/context** from other layers, developer, and devops.
- No `Task` nesting. No product behavior changes.
- No git commit.

## Inputs (parent injects)

- `REPO_ROOT`, `FEATURE_SLUG` (parent slug), `WORKFLOW`, `TEST_LAYER: unit | api | ui`
- Optional `TESTER_MODE: cases-only` — write `qa-test-cases.md` and return. Do not run tests.
- `TEST_PLAN_PATH` / `PATCH_PATH` / `RCA_PATH` as applicable
- When `TEST_DESIGN_ENABLED: true`, `features/{slug}/test-design/cases.json` is the case list

## Work

1. If `TESTER_MODE` is `cases-only`: write `qa-test-cases.md` from the plan / patch / RCA (or use rendered cases when test design is on). Return SUCCESS. Do not run runners.
2. Do **not** rewrite `qa-test-cases.md` or `cases.json` when they already exist.
3. Load only the skill for `TEST_LAYER`:
   - `unit` → [testing-unit](../skills/testing-unit/SKILL.md)
   - `api` → [testing-api](../skills/testing-api/SKILL.md)
   - `ui` → [testing-ui-playwright](../skills/testing-ui-playwright/SKILL.md) (browser `e2e` and `a11y` ride here)
4. On failure: copy [tester-rca-template.md](../skills/feature-development/assets/tester-rca-template.md) to `tester-rca-{layer}.md`. Classify `cause: test | product | unclear` (`unclear` = product).
   - `test`: heal test artifacts only (max 2). Rerun. Do not weaken Expected or skip cases.
   - `product`: HANDOFF `NEEDS_APPROVAL`. Stop. Do not edit product. Do not spawn developer.
5. Feature class cannot finish a required layer as cases-only. Micro/minor may skip `ui` when no case is tagged `ui` or browser `e2e`.

## Outputs

```text
features/{slug}/HANDOFF-tester-{layer}.md
features/{slug}/state/tester-{layer}.json
features/{slug}/tester-rca-{layer}.md   # on failure
```

UI layer also writes specs and screenshots under `automation-tests/` when that layer ran.

## Failure

| Case | HANDOFF |
|------|---------|
| Plan / cases missing | `FAILED` `INPUT_MISSING` |
| Required layer not run | not SUCCESS |
| Test-side still failing after 2 heals | `FAILED` |
| Product AC mismatch | `NEEDS_APPROVAL` (parent waits) |
| Bug: reproduction still live / missing regression | `NEEDS_APPROVAL` or `BLOCKED` as the RCA skill says |

## HANDOFF

```text
HANDOFF tester-agent → parent
TEST_LAYER: unit | api | ui
STATUS: SUCCESS | FAILED | NEEDS_APPROVAL | BLOCKED
RCA_PATH: features/{slug}/tester-rca-{layer}.md | n/a
CAUSE: test | product | none
OWNING_CHILD: {child-slug} | patch | rca | n/a
SCREENSHOTS_PATH: automation-tests/artifacts/{slug}/screenshots/ | n/a
PARENT_NEXT: join-tester-wave | stop for user
```
