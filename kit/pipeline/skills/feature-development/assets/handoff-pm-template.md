### Status values (mandatory)

| status | When | `ready_for_ba` | Parent |
|--------|------|----------------|--------|
| `SUCCESS` | P5 blockers pass | `true` | `@signoff:requirements`, then Architect or BA |
| `ASSUMPTIONS_USED` | User said proceed; defaults labeled | `true` | Same; later agents must stress-test Assumptions |
| `BLOCKED` | Interactive wait, unsafe ask, or missing scope | `false` | Wait for user then re-run PM, or stop |

Do not report `SUCCESS` when blockers fail or Must decisions are still open.
