## Summary
{3–6 sentences: chosen shape, ADRs, child split, what was challenged}

## Evidence used
- {path}: {fact}

## Concerns
{none | C-1 recorded/blocking: one line each}

## Challenge audience
none | user | pm

## Assumptions used (if any)
- A-1: …

## Open questions left
- none | OQ-1: …

## Failure / recovery (if not SUCCESS)

## Parent next step
Wait for @signoff:architect (present recorded concerns), then spawn ba-agent.
Do not start developer-agent. Pass state/architect-agent.json to BA — not this body.
If BLOCKED_CHALLENGE_PM: void signoff-requirements.md, re-spawn PM, user re-signs, then Architect again.
If BLOCKED with user questions: wait, then re-spawn Architect.
```

### Status values (mandatory)

| status | When | `ready_for_ba` | Parent |
|--------|------|----------------|--------|
| `SUCCESS` | A4 blockers pass | `true` | `@signoff:architect`, then BA |
| `ASSUMPTIONS_USED` | User said proceed; defaults labeled in ADRs | `true` | Same; BA critic stress-tests defaults |
| `BLOCKED` | User questions or incomplete design | `false` | Wait; re-spawn Architect |
| `BLOCKED_CHALLENGE_PM` | Requirements must change (feature-development only) | `false` | Void requirements sign-off; re-spawn PM |

Do not report `SUCCESS` when blockers fail or Must architecture decisions are still open.
