# spec_completeness — target: pipeline.step ba-agent — score 0–1

You are grading the specification work of a business-analyst agent in a coding
pipeline. The task brief is in INPUT; the agent's status, HANDOFF summary, and any
critic verdict are in OUTPUT.

INPUT:
{{input}}

OUTPUT:
{{output}}

Score 0–1 how complete the produced specification is, based on what the HANDOFF
claims and evidences:
- Must-have functional requirements are enumerated (not vague themes).
- Each Must FR has at least one testable acceptance criterion.
- Out-of-scope / non-goals are stated explicitly.
- Affected users/personas or entry points are identified.

Scoring: 1.0 = all four present and concrete; 0.5 = FRs and ACs present but
out-of-scope or personas missing; 0.0 = no enumerable FRs or ACs. If OUTPUT contains
no HANDOFF content at all, score 0 and say "no artifact clip".

Return the score and a one-sentence reason.
