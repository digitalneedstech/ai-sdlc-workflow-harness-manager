- **Layer:** pipeline
- **Load when:** product-manager-agent, prd.md, nested features/{slug}/{child}/, spec-order.md, waves, one feature-level tester

## Symptom

A feature-class ask starts at BA with one flat specification.md, or testers run between child specs, or devops ships without Playwright.

## Root cause

Feature class is now a parent folder: PM (or intake) plans first, the user signs requirements, Architect may run, BA splits children, parent fans out implementation waves, one tester signs off.

## Do not

- Spawn Architect or BA before `signoff-requirements.md`
- Ask what `decisions.md` or the repo already answers
- Put sibling slugs at features/ instead of features/{feature}/{child}/
- Run tester-agent per child or between waves
- Mark tester SUCCESS as TESTS: cases-only on feature class
- Start devops without FEATURE_SIGNOFF: passed
- Start waves without `signoff-ba.md`

## Convention

1. Parent writes features/{slug}/route.md and pipeline-state.json (change_class: feature).
2. product-manager-agent analyzes as-is in the repo, writes prd.md, research.md, decisions.md, and state/product-manager-agent.json. Clarify-first questions (max 20).
3. Parent `@signoff:requirements`. Then architect-policy; large stories run architect-agent.
4. ba-agent writes each features/{slug}/{child}/specification.md, spec-order.md (**children:** line), test-plan.md, and per-child test-strategy.md.
5. After BA critic approve and `@signoff:ba`, parent runs waves: per child telemetry then developer then developer-critic. Parallel children share a wave.
6. One tester-agent at the parent slug runs Playwright/api/unit from the test plan.
7. Devops only after qa-signoff.md has FEATURE_SIGNOFF: passed.

Micro/minor unchanged (flat folder, no PM, no Architect, no tester unless policy on).

## Files

.pipeline/agents/product-manager-agent.md, .pipeline/skills/product-planning/SKILL.md, .pipeline/skills/spec-generation/SKILL.md, .pipeline/skills/feature-development/SKILL.md, .pipeline/wiki/feature-pipeline-architect-and-signoff.md

## Verify

features/{slug}/prd.md and signoff-requirements.md exist before Architect or BA. Child specs are subfolders. HANDOFF-tester.md is after every child critic. qa-signoff.md exists before devops.
